#### Deliverables
- A user could add, remove item to the shopping cart, update the quantity of items in the cart, and see the subtotal, tax, delivery amount and total amount
- Add a small badge at the top right corner of the 'Cart' text, which indicates how many items (not quantity) are currently in the cart
- Add basic setup for jest and some unit tests

#### Additional Thoughs/Comments
---
- Overall my free time these days is less I thought but I tried to speed up on this 
- As mentioend in the requirement I didn't do much styling for the exercise. But given design & time I'm pretty confident of my css skills for implementing pixel-perfect mockup
- The unit tests I added is to show how and where I normally write tests. Not to indicate these are the only tests needed for the application
- I'm aware that some of the things is not opted to the best. Like normally I'd use `combineReducers` to construct the final reducers with smaller reducers, and I know normally it's not a good practice to define anonymous function as props. But given the time and scale of this exercise I decided not to focus on those and leave those to discussion if needed.

#### Thank you!
